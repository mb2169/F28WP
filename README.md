- completed tasks
- added google fonts, center aligned text, added a sticky nav bar which stays on page as users scroll down.
- currently active page is now highlighted in the nav bar


week3 - https://mb2169.github.io/F28WP-lab1/week3/

- added slideshow for gallery images
- added form validation in form.html

One of the issues i faced in implementing the slide show was that the slideshow images 
were overlapping over the sticky navigation bar as I scrolled down the website. I fixed this
by adding z-index: 1 in the sticky nav bar properties to ensure that the nav bar always appears
above the other elements on the page.

Added form validation using regular expressions to check if email input matched standard format
