added slideshow for gallery images

One of the issues i faced in implementing the slide show was that the slideshow images 
were overlapping over the sticky navigation bar as I scrolled down the website. I fixed this
by adding z-index: 1 in the sticky nav bar properties to ensure that the nav bar always appears
above the other elements on the page.
